# My C Projects (0 to Hero)

Welcome to my **"0 to Hero"** C programming journey! 🚀  
This repository is a collection of projects that showcase my learning progress in C — starting from the basics and moving towards more complex topics. Each project resides in its own folder, along with relevant documentation and source code.

### 📖 Overview

This repository is a collection of **100+ C projects** (and potentially more!). The goals of this journey are:

- **Practice by Doing**: Strengthen my C programming skills through hands-on experience.
- **Explore Various Domains**: Work on console applications, data structures, algorithms, system programming, networking, and more.
- **Build a Portfolio**: Showcase my projects for learning, collaboration, and future opportunities.

Each project builds upon previous concepts, ensuring steady progress towards **mastery** in C programming.

### 📂 Repository Structure

Each project is stored in a separate folder, organized sequentially:

```
My_C_Projects/
├── 01_Hello_World/
│   ├── main.c
│   ├── README.md
│   └── ...
├── 02_Simple_Calculator/
│   ├── main.c
│   └── README.md
│   └── ...
├── 03_String_Manipulator/
├── 04_...
├── .gitignore
├── README.md  <-- (this file)
└── ...
```

Each project folder contains:

- `main.c` (or appropriately named `.c` files) containing the source code.
- `README.md` with details on how the project works.
- Additional files such as `Makefile`, libraries, or data files (if required).
